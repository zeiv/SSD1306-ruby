This is a library for the SSD1306 OLED Display written in Ruby.  It was inspired by Adafruit's libraries written in Python and C.  Much of the original logic was simply ported from their Python library, but in addition this Ruby library provides additional functionality such as `print` and `println` helpers.  The library also features simple image parsing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'SSD1306'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install SSD1306

## Usage

Using the library is simple.  To start with, require the library and initialize the display:

```ruby
require 'SSD1306'
disp = SSD1306::Display.new
```

The default options are suitable for the Raspberry Pi and a 128x64 display.  These can be overridden by specifying values like so:

```ruby
disp = SSD1306::Display.new(protocol: :i2c, path: '/dev/i2c-1', address: 0x3C, width: 128, height: 64)
```

Writing text on the display is simple:

```ruby
disp.println "This is my IP Address:"
disp.println "" # The same as disp.print "\n"
disp.font_size = 2
disp.println ip_address
disp.display!
```

The display can also be easily cleared:

```ruby
disp.clear
disp.display!

# Or more simply:
disp.clear!
```

Check out the source code for additional information.

## To-do

* Currently only 1, 2, and 4 work as font sizes. In the meantime, to use other fonts or font sizes, I recommend using RMagick's `annotate` feature and passing in an image.
* Implement SPI.  Only I2C is currently supported. (For v1.0)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. Run `bundle exec SSD1306` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
